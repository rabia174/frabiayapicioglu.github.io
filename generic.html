						Fatima Rabia Yapicioglu received the BSc degree in computer engineering from Ankara University Engineering Faculty
						including exchange studies at the University of Eastern Finland Computing School, in 2021, and currently a MSc student
						at the University of Padova, Italy. She earned Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation scholarship for
						two consecutive years, and has been awarded with 'Mille e una Lode' honor degree and best machine learning project from
						Galileo Galilei Physics of Data Department of UNIPD during her MSc studies. She is currently doing research in collaboration
						with Kings College, London on dopamine hormone brain lateralization in healthy controls and schizophrenia patients compromising
						XAI(Explainable Artificial Intelligence). Her past experience includes contributing to medical applications and artificial intelligence
						convergence at the ICT Medical Development Center of the Kuopio University Hospital, Finland. Currently, she works as an artificial intelligence
						specialist intern at the Baker Hughes American company which has subsidiaries GE and Bently Nevada. Her main research interests lie predominantly
						in the field of artificial intelligence for life sciences and health applications, explainable artificial intelligence, computer vision, time series analysis ,
						and machine learning.
