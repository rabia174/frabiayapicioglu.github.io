									This study will provide a comparison between two ways of customizing a pre-trained model using transfer

									Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ) is a painful jaw disorder that stems

									Dataset which consists of 565 MRI images belonging to 8 groups has been prepared and splitted into train, validation and test sets by hand manually.
									Transfer learning on a training set of 361 images and 5 different model structures MobileNetV2, Densenet121, Xception, InceptionV3, Resnet101 have been
									used for training, 82 images for validation, and 121 images have been used for testing. Also Grad-CAMs which are developed to annotate areas with disorders or
									having the probability of disorder has been used for each model.

									This study evaluates the effect of noise on student-surgeons’ performance in three microsurgery related tasks.
									The experiments were conducted in Kuopio University Hospital where 21 students volunteered for the study.
									The participants performed the three tasks in both a silent environment and a noisy environment where the
									participants were subject to a 85db noise played via headphones. Their performance was visually recorded and
									their biometrics as well as eye tracks were collected by specialized machinery [5], [6]. After finishing their tasks,
									the students self-evaluated how demanding the procedure felt for them and the video footage of their performance
									was given for two blinded surgeons to evaluate for the quality, efficiency and handling of it. We performed a two sample t-test on the quality of knot, efficiency and handling and the reported distractions and mental, physical
									and temporal demands. We found significant difference (p=0.05) in the performance evaluations in three of
									those areas, namely: Efficiency, physical demands and distractions. The assessed performance efficiency was
									reduced by 15% while the reported physical demands increased by 88% and distractions by 156%.

									and which cities are in danger when we have seen a cluster of cases in one city. From there, it allows us to estimate invasion risk, and in more advance learn what
